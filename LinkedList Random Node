We are asked to implement two interfaces in the object, namely the init(head) and getRandom() functions.

The init(head) function would be invoked once when we construct the object. Within which, intuitively we could convert the given linked list into an array for later reuse.

Concerning the getRandom() function, with the linked list converted into an array, we could simply sample from this array.

class Solution {

ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();
    public Solution(ListNode head) {
        while(head != null){
            arr.add(head.val);
            head = head.next;
        }
    }
    
    public int getRandom() {
        int random = (int)(Math.random()*arr.size());
        return arr.get(random);
    }
}
