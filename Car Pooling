Count in/out algo

Intuition
Since we only have 1,001 stops, we can just figure out how many people get it and out in each location.

Solution
Process all trips, adding passenger count to the start location, and removing it from the end location. After processing all trips, a positive value for the specific location tells that we are getting more passengers; negative - more empty seats.

Finally, scan all stops and check if we ever exceed our vehicle capacity.


class Solution {
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
         int[] arr = new int[1001];
        
        for(int[] trip : trips){
            int savari = trip[0];
            int from = trip[1];
            int to = trip[2];
            
            arr[from] = arr[from] + savari;
            arr[to] = arr[to] - savari;
        }
        
        int sum =0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            sum = sum + arr[i];
            if(sum > capacity) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
