Two steps :- 1.) set al bits means make all bits to 1 and then substract the the value of n in bits, then you got the complemwnt.
              2.) then do (Math.pow(2,z) - 1 - n);    means z is the digits in the complement bit, by this we get the final answer
              
              
 Hints
what is the relationship between input and output
input + output = 111....11 in binary format
Is there any corner case?
0 is a corner case expecting 1, output > input
Intuition
Let's find the first number X that X = 1111....1 > N
And also, it has to be noticed that,
N = 0 is a corner case expecting1 as result.
##same code for problem 476

Solution 1:
N + bitwiseComplement(N) = 11....11 = X
Then bitwiseComplement(N) = X - N

Java:

    public int bitwiseComplement(int N) {
        int X = 1;
        while (N > X) X = X * 2 + 1;
        return X - N;
    }





for example:
100110, its complement is 011001, the sum is 111111. So we only need get the min number large or equal to num, then do substraction

    public int findComplement(int num) 
    {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        
        while (i < num)
        {
            i += Math.pow(2, j);
            j++;
        }
        
        return i - num;
    }
